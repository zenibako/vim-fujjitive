INTRODUCTION                                    *fujjitive*

Whenever you edit a file from a JJ repository, a set of commands is defined
that serve as a gateway to JJ.

INSTALLATION                                    *fujjitive-installation*

For lazy.nvim (https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), add the following to your
plugin list:
>lua
    {
      "your-username/vim-fujjitive",
    }
<
For Vim's built-in package support:
>
    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vim-fujjitive.git
    vim -u NONE -c "helptags fujjitive/doc" -c q

COMMANDS                                        *fujjitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *fujjitive-:G*
:J [args]               Same as :JJ, but two characters shorter.

                                                *fujjitive-summary*
:JJ                    With no arguments, bring up a summary window vaguely
                        akin to jj status.  If a summary window is already
                        open for the current repository, it is focused
                        instead.  Press g?  or see |fujjitive-maps| for usage.

                                                *:JJ*
:JJ {args}             Run an arbitrary jj command and display any output.
                        On UNIX this uses a pty and on other platforms it uses
                        a pipe, which will cause some behavior differences
                        such as the absence of progress bars.  Any file the
                        command edits (for example, a commit message) will be
                        loaded into a split window.  Closing that window will
                        resume running the command.  A few JJ subcommands
                        have different behavior; these are documented below.

                                                *:JJ!*
:JJ! {args}            Run an arbitrary jj command in the background and
                        stream the output to the preview window.  Requires a
                        Vim with |setbufline()|.  Press CTRL-D during an
                        interactive :JJ invocation to switch to this mode
                        retroactively.

                                                *:JJ_--paginate* *:JJ_-p*
:JJ --paginate {args}  Run an arbitrary jj command, capture output to a temp
:JJ -p {args}          file, and |:split| that temp file.  Pass ++curwin as
                        the first argument to |:edit| the temp file instead.
                        A temp file is always used for commands like diff and
                        log that typically uses a pager, and for any command
                        that has the pager.<cmd> JJ configuration option set.

:{range}Git! --paginate {args}
:{range}Git! -p {args}  Run an arbitrary jj command, and insert the output
                        after {range} in the current buffer.

                                                *:JJ_blame*
:JJ blame [flags]      Run jj file annotate [flags] on the current file and open the
                        results in a scroll-bound vertical split.  The
                        following maps, which work on the cursor line commit
                        where sensible, are provided:

                        g?    show this help
                        A     resize to end of author column
                        C     resize to end of commit column
                        D     resize to end of date/time column
                        gq    close blame, then |:Gedit| to return to work
                              tree version
                        <CR>  close blame, and jump to patch that added line
                              (or directly to blob for boundary commit)
                        o     jump to patch or blob in horizontal split
                        O     jump to patch or blob in new tab
                        p     jump to patch or blob in preview window
                        -     reblame at commit

                        The maps |fujjitive_P| and |fujjitive_~| are also
                        supported to reblame on a parent commit, but this is
                        inherently fragile, as the line being blamed will no
                        longer exist.  The preferred alternative is to use
                        <CR> to open up the commit, select the corresponding
                        `-` line that you care about, and press <CR> twice
                        more to reblame at that line.  Viewing the commit also
                        gives you additional context as to why the line
                        changed.

                                                *g:fujjitive_dynamic_colors*
                        In the GUI or a 256 color terminal, commit hashes will
                        be highlighted in different colors. To disable this:
>
                        let g:fujjitive_dynamic_colors = 0
<
:[range]Git blame [...] If a range is given, just that part of the file will
:JJ blame [...] {file} be blamed, and a horizontal split without
                        scrollbinding is used.  You can also give an arbitrary
                        filename.

                                                *:JJ_difftool*
:JJ[!] difftool [args] Invoke `jj diff [args]` and load the changes into the
                        quickfix list.  Each changed hunk gets a separate
                        quickfix entry unless you pass an option like
                        --name-only or --name-status.  Jumps to the first
                        change unless [!] is given.

:JJ difftool -y [args] Invoke `jj diff [args]`, open each changed file in a
                        new tab, and invoke |:Gdiffsplit!| against the
                        appropriate commit.

                                                *:JJ_mergetool*
:JJ mergetool [args]   Like |:Git_difftool|, but target merge conflicts.

Wrappers for Vim built-ins ~

These all directly map onto a built-in Vim command, and generally have names
that prepend "G" to the command they are wrapping.  For example, :Ggrep is G
plus |:grep|.

                                                *:Ggrep* *:JJ_grep*
:Ggrep[!] [args]        An approximation of |:grep|[!] with jj grep as
:JJ[!] grep -O [args]  'grepprg'.

:Ggrep[!] --quiet [args]
:Ggrep[!] -q [args]     Like |:Ggrep|, but instead of displaying output, open
                        the quickfix list.

                                                *:Glgrep*
:Glgrep[!] [args]       :Ggrep but for |:lgrep|.
:0Git[!] grep -O [args]

                                                 *:Gclog*
:Gclog[!] [args]        Use jj log [args] to load the commit history into the
                        |quickfix| list.  Jumps to the first commit unless [!]
                        is given.  This command wraps |:cfile|.

                        The quickfix list can be awkward for many use cases
                        and exhibits extremely poor performance with larger
                        data sets.  Consider using |:JJ| log --oneline
                        instead.

:{range}Gclog[!] [args] Use jj log -L to load previous revisions of the given
                        range of the current file into the |quickfix| list.
                        The cursor is positioned on the first line of the
                        first diff hunk for each commit.  Use :0Gclog to
                        target the entire file.

                                                *:Gllog*
:Gllog [args]           Like |:Gclog|, but use the location list instead of the
                        |quickfix| list.

                                                *:Gcd*
:Gcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the repository.

                                                *:Glcd*
:Glcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the repository.

                                                *:Gedit* *fujjitive-:Ge*
:Gedit [object]         |:edit| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gsplit*
:Gsplit [object]        |:split| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gvsplit*
:Gvsplit [object]       |:vsplit| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gtabedit*
:Gtabedit [object]      |:tabedit| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gpedit*
:Gpedit [object]        |:pedit| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gdrop*
:Gdrop [object]         |:drop| a |fujjitive-object|.

                                                *:Gread* *fujjitive-:Gr*
:Gread [object]         Empty the buffer and |:read| a |fujjitive-object|.
                        When the argument is omitted, this is similar to
                        git-checkout on a work tree file or git-add on a stage
                        file, but without writing anything to disk.

:{range}Gread [object]  |:read| in a |fujjitive-object| after {range}.

                                                *:Gwrite* *fujjitive-:Gw*
:Gwrite                 Write to the current file's path and stage the results.
                        When run in a work tree file, it is effectively git
                        add.  Elsewhere, it is effectively git-checkout.  A
                        great deal of effort is expended to behave sensibly
                        when the work tree or index version of the file is
                        open in another buffer.

:Gwrite {path}          You can give |:Gwrite| an explicit path of where in
                        the work tree to write.  You can also give a path like
                        :0:foo.txt or :0:% to write to just that stage in
                        the index.

                                                *:Gwq*
:Gwq [path]             Like |:Gwrite| followed by |:quit| if the write
                        succeeded.

:Gwq! [path]            Like |:Gwrite|! followed by |:quit|! if the write
                        succeeded.

                                                *:Gdiffsplit*
:Gdiffsplit [object]    Perform a |vimdiff| against the given file, or if a
                        commit is given, the current file in that commit.
                        With no argument, the version in the index or work
                        tree is used, and the work tree version is always
                        placed to the right or bottom, depending on available
                        width.  Use Vim's |do| and |dp| to stage and unstage
                        changes.

                                                *:Gdiffsplit!*
:Gdiffsplit!            Diff against any and all direct ancestors, retaining
                        focus on the current window.  During a merge conflict,
                        this is a three-way diff against the "ours" and
                        "theirs" ancestors.  Additional d2o and d3o maps are
                        provided to obtain the hunk from the "ours" or
                        "theirs" ancestor, respectively.

:Gdiffsplit! {object}   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but retain focus on the current
                        window.

                                                *:Gvdiffsplit*
:Gvdiffsplit [object]   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but always split vertically.

                                                *:Ghdiffsplit*
:Gdiffsplit ++novertical [object]
:Ghdiffsplit [object]   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but with "vertical" removed from
                        'diffopt'.  The split will still be vertical if
                        combined with |:vertical|.

Other commands ~

These do not directly correspond to any built-in Vim command, and have a
capital letter after the "G" to convey this. For example, the file move
operation has nothing to do with the |:move| built-in, so it is named :GMove,
not :Gmove.

                                                *:GMove*
:GMove {destination}    Wrapper around git-mv that renames the buffer
                        afterward.  Add a ! to pass -f.

                                                *:GRename*
:GRename {destination}  Like |:GMove| but operates relative to the parent
                        directory of the current file.

                                                *:GDelete*
:GDelete                Wrapper around git-rm that deletes the buffer
                        afterward.  When invoked in an index file, --cached is
                        passed.  Add a ! to pass -f and forcefully discard the
                        buffer.

                                                *:GRemove* *:GUnlink*
:GRemove                Like |:GDelete|, but keep the (now empty) buffer around.
:GUnlink

                                                *:GBrowse*
:GBrowse                Open the current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag
                        in your browser at the upstream hosting provider.
                        Upstream providers can be added by installing an
                        appropriate Vim plugin.  For example, GitHub can be
                        supported by installing rhubarb.vim, available at
                        <https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb>.

:GBrowse {object}       Like :GBrowse, but for a given |fujjitive-object|.

:{range}GBrowse [args]  Appends an anchor to the URL that emphasizes the
                        selected lines. This also forces the URL to include a
                        commit rather than a branch name so it remains valid
                        if the file changes.  You can give a range of "0" to
                        force this behavior without including an anchor.

:GBrowse [...]@{remote} Force using the given remote rather than the remote
                        for the current branch.  The remote is used to
                        determine which upstream repository to link to.

:GBrowse {url}          Open an arbitrary URL in your browser.

:[range]GBrowse! [args] Like :GBrowse, but put the URL on the clipboard rather
                        than opening it.

MAPS                                            *fujjitive-maps*

These maps are available in both the |fujjitive-summary| buffer and Fujjitive
object buffers, although not all maps make sense in all buffers.  Mappings
that operate on the file or hunk under the cursor are generally available in
visual mode to operate on multiple files or partial hunks.

                                                *fujjitive-splitting-maps*
Splitting/squashing maps ~

                                                *fujjitive_s*
s                       Split the file or hunk under the cursor into a new
                        change (using `jj split`).

                                                *fujjitive_u*
u                       Squash the file or hunk under the cursor back into the
                        parent change (using `jj squash`).

SPECIFYING OBJECTS                      *fujjitive-object* *fujjitive-revision*

Fujjitive objects are either work tree files or Git revisions as defined in the
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in the git-rev-parse man page, with expansions
inspired by |cmdline-special| layered on top.  For commands that accept an
optional object, the default is the file in the index for work tree files and
the work tree file for everything else.  Example objects follow.

Object          Meaning ~
@               The commit referenced by @ aka HEAD
master          The commit referenced by master
master^         The parent of the commit referenced by master
master...other  The merge base of master and other
master:         The tree referenced by master
./master        The file named master in the working directory
:(top)master    The file named master in the work tree
Makefile        The file named Makefile in the work tree
@^:Makefile     The file named Makefile in the parent of HEAD
:Makefile       The file named Makefile in the index (writable)
@~2:%           The current file in the grandparent of HEAD
:%              The current file in the index
:1:%            The current file's common ancestor during a conflict
:2:#            The alternate file in the target branch during a conflict
:3:#5           The file from buffer #5 in the merged branch during a conflict
!               The commit owning the current file
!:Makefile      The file named Makefile in the commit owning the current file
!3^2            The second parent of the commit owning buffer #3
.jj/config     The repo config file
:               The |fujjitive-summary| buffer
-               A temp file containing the last |:JJ| invocation's output
<cfile>         The file or commit under the cursor

STATUSLINE                                      *fujjitive-statusline*

                                *FujjitiveStatusline()* *fujjitive#statusline()*
Add %{FujjitiveStatusline()} to your statusline to get an indicator including
the current branch and the currently edited file's commit.  If you don't have
a statusline, this one matches the default when 'ruler' is set:
>
        set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{FujjitiveStatusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<
AUTOCOMMANDS                                    *fujjitive-autocommands*

A handful of |User| |autocommands| are provided to allow extending and
overriding Fujjitive behaviors.  Example usage:
>
        autocmd User FujjitiveBlob,FujjitiveStageBlob call s:BlobOverrides()
<
                                                *User_FujjitiveTag*
FujjitiveTag             After loading a tag object.

                                                *User_FujjitiveCommit*
FujjitiveCommit          After loading a commit object.

                                                *User_FujjitiveTree*
FujjitiveTree            After loading a tree (directory) object.

                                                *User_FujjitiveStageBlob*
FujjitiveStageBlob       After loading a split blob (file) object.  These
                        buffers are 'modifiable' and oftentimes don't want the
                        same behavior as the other buffer types.

                                                *User_FujjitiveIndex*
FujjitiveIndex           After loading the |fujjitive-summary| buffer.

                                                *User_FujjitivePager*
FujjitivePager           After loading a temp file created by a command like
                        :JJ --paginate or :JJ blame.

                                                *User_FujjitiveEditor*
FujjitiveEditor          After a :JJ command (e.g., :JJ commit) edits a file
                        (e.g., the commit message).

                                                *User_FujjitiveChanged*
FujjitiveChanged         After any event which can potentially change the
                        repository, for example, any invocation of |:JJ|.
                        Originally intended for expiring caches, but can have
                        other uses.

API                                             *fujjitive-api*

Officially supported functions are documented inline in plugin/fugitive.vim.

DEPRECATIONS                                    *fujjitive-deprecated*

The following commands are deprecated in favor of replacements that adhere to
a new naming scheme.  Remember that |:JJ| can be shortened to |:G|, so
replacements using it are just one space character longer than the legacy
version.

*:Gremove*      Superseded by |:GRemove|.
*:Gdelete*      Superseded by |:GDelete|.
*:Gmove*        Superseded by |:GMove|.
*:Grename*      Superseded by |:GRename|.
*:Gbrowse*      Superseded by |:GBrowse|.
*:Gdiff*        Superseded by |:Gdiffsplit|
*:Gsdiff*       Superseded by |:Ghdiffsplit|
*:Gvdiff*       Superseded by |:Gvdiffsplit| or |:vert| |:Gdiffsplit|.
*:Gblame*       Superseded by |:Git_blame|.
*:Gcommit*      Superseded by |:JJ| commit.
*:Gmerge*       Superseded by |:JJ| merge and |:Git_mergetool|.
*:Gpull*        Superseded by |:JJ| pull.
*:Grebase*      Superseded by |:JJ| rebase.
*:Grevert*      Superseded by |:JJ| revert.

*:Gstatus*      Superseded by |:JJ| (with no arguments).
*:Gsplit!*      Superseded by |:Git_--paginate|.
*:Gvsplit!*     Superseded by :vert Git --paginate.
*:Gtabsplit!*   Superseded by :tab Git --paginate.
*:Gpedit!*      Superseded by :JJ! --paginate.

                                                *User_Fujjitive*
Fujjitive used to support `:autocmd User Fujjitive` to run an autocommand after
loading any buffer belonging to a JJ repository, but this has been phased
out.  Instead, one can leverage regular autocommand events like |BufNewFile|
and |BufReadPost|, and check !empty(FujjitiveJJDir()) to confirm Fujjitive has
found a repository.  See also |fujjitive-autocommands| for other, more
selective events.
